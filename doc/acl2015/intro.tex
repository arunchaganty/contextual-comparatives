\section{Introduction}

% motivation
When posed with a numeric mention, such as ``The \$17 billion NASA budget [\dots]'', it is often difficult to comprehend the scale of large (and small) absolute values like \textit{\$17 billion}. 
Studies have repeatedly shown\needcite{} that providing relative comparisons, such as ``The NASA budget is 0.1\% of the US national budget'' significantly improves comprehension, e.g.\ when measured in terms of memory retention or otherwise.
% HCI work
Indeed, previous work in the HCI community has 
However, this is limited in the range of facts it can express while still using a small database of ground truths.

In this work, we leverage compositionality to achieve broad coverage from a relatively small collection of relevant facts.
In doing so, we must address two key challenges: selecting familiar, relevant and easy-to-understand expressions and generating easy-to-digest perspectives.
We tackle the first challenge using a search guided by supervised data --- signals from proximity, similairty, compositionality.
We treat the problem of generation as a translation problem and use a neural sequence-to-sequence model that supports copying to generate perspectives from numeric expressions.

We evaluate our work on 30,000 numeric mentions collected from different newswire corpora and generate perspectives from a manually curated database of 180 facts.
