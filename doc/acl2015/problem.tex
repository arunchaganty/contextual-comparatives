\section{Problem statement}

collection of facts be $\sF$, an let each fact be a tuple $f(s, v, u)$, where $s$ is subject (description), $v$ is the numeric value and $u$ is a unit.

A unit is a rational expression of the following fundamental units:

A numeric mention $m(s, v, u)$ is a span of tokens within a sentence $s$, describing a numeric quantity of magnitude $v$ and units $u$.

We provide unit conversion.

Finally, we search for a numeric expression, which is $m * f_1 * f_2 * f_3$; we found that addition, subtraction and division are unnatural in combination and rarely used, thus ignored.

Generate numeric perspective $p$.



Our goal is to solve NLP\@.
